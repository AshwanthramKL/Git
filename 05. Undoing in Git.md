### **Reset :**  

```
git reset
```
It lists the files that have been unstaged after this command was executed.

**[ OR ]**  

```
git reset [file_name]
```
Resets the particular file.

**[ OR ]**

```
git reset HEAD~1
```
HEAD -> pointer pointing to the last commit.

The above command will reset back to the last second commit
(i.e 1 commit before HEAD).

**[ OR ]**

In case, if we want to revert back to a particluar commit :  
* Use the ```git log``` command.
* Copy the **commit hash (long alpha-numeric)** of the desired commit.
* Enter the following command :  

```
git reset [commit hash]
```
> Note:  
    The changes will still be there.  
    It just won't be staged.  

If we also want to undo the changes / code / text, then
```
git reset --hard [commit hash]
```
