# **Reflog :**  

Git's diary / journal. 

### **Recovering commits :**  

Let's say we deleted a few commits and then realise that we need them.  
Hence we retrive them with the help of reflog.

```
git reflog
```

Copy the hash id of the desired revision and use the [reset command](https://github.com/AshwanthramKL/Git/blob/main/5.%20Undoing%20in%20Git.md#reset-).

**[ OR ]**

Create a new branch that starts at the previsous revision with the correct state.
```
git branch [branch name] [revision hash]
```

Use :
