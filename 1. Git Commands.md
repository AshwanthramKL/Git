# **Git Commands**



### **Init :**

```
git init
```
Initializes the existing folder into Git as a repository.

>   __Hint :__    
    When a repository is created in the code editor with init command and not cloned from Github, it cannot be Pushed into Github.  
    So do the following:  
    *  Create empty repo in Github and copy its SSH link.  
    * Go to terminal and enter the following  
    ```
    git remote add [ssh link]
    ```  
    Now your good to go. ;)
___
### **Clone :**   

```
git clone [ssh link]
```
Creates a copy of the repository in the local machine from Github(Web).  

>   __Hint :__    
    `ls -la` displays all the file including hidden files.  
    And the **.git** file contains and saves all the
    changes made to the repo.

     git commit -am "Topic Msg" 
     ```  
    -am : add and message.
___

### **Push :**

```
git push [variable name] [branch]
```
variable name - usually "origin" / location of our git repository.  
branch - usually "master" / branch we want to push into.

**[ OR ]**

Instead of typing this long command all the time,  
we can set and upstream(a default location to push the code everytime).

```
git push -u [variable name] [branch]

Now, we can just use 

```
git push
