# **Cherry Picking :**  

 Cherry picking is the act of **picking a commit** from a branch and applying it to another.
     
Let's say we made a commit to a wrong branch, we can use cherry picking to transfer that commit to another branch.
>Note:  
It is a not a replacement for merge and rebase.

* Go to the desired branch.
* Use the following command to cherry-pick the commit.
```
git cherry-pick [commit hash]
```
